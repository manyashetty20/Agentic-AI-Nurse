# Agentic-AI-Nurse

This project contains several small apps and utilities for building an agentic medical assistant (RAG/LLM + vector DB) and example frontends.

## What is in this repo
- `main.py` - root entrypoint / demo script (inspect to confirm behavior)
- `build_vectordb.py` - utilities for building a vector DB from documents
- `dashboard.html`, `index.html`, `dispatch_form.html`, `script.js`, `style.css` - small frontend/demo files
- `1/` - an app/agent example with `app.py`, `agent_logic.py`, `main.py`
- `inventory/` - inventory management app with its own `requirements.txt` and scripts
- `knowledge_base/` - plain-text knowledge documents used for RAG
- `chroma_db/` - local Chroma DB sqlite file (may be generated by scripts)

## Prerequisites
- macOS (tested here)
- Python 3.11+ recommended (install a matching venv)
- zsh is the default shell for the environment instructions below

## Quick start (recommended)
1. Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

2. Install dependencies (from the repository root):

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run a demo script (one of the small apps). Examples:

- Run the main demo (if present):

```bash
python main.py
```

- Run the FastAPI app (if you want to try the API):

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

- Run the example Streamlit UI (if used):

```bash
streamlit run inventory/app.py
```

4. Build the vector DB from `knowledge_base/` (if desired):

```bash
python build_vectordb.py
```

## Notes about requirements
- This repository contains multiple `requirements.txt` files (root, `1/requirements.txt`, `inventory/requirements.txt`). The root `requirements.txt` is a consolidated list with common/pinned packages. Subfolders may override or pin different versions for their apps.
- If you need reproducible installs for a specific sub-app, install that folder's `requirements.txt` inside an isolated venv.

## Project structure (high-level)
- `knowledge_base/` - textual medical notes used for retrieval
- `chroma_db/` - persisted Chroma DB (sqlite) used for quick demos
- `1/` and `inventory/` - two small apps demonstrating different workflows

## Tips
- If you plan to use GPU acceleration or specific transformers, pin appropriate versions of `torch`, `transformers`, and `sentence-transformers` per your hardware.
- When experimenting with `langchain`, prefer creating a new venv per experiment to avoid dependency conflicts.

## Next steps / TODOs
- Add example `.env.example` with expected environment variables (API keys, model endpoints)
- Add small test script that imports core dependencies to validate the environment
